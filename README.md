# Rental-Listing

This Project is devoted to the Kaggle competition Rental Listing Inquiry
In this competition, I will predict how popular an apartment rental listing is based on the listing content like text description, photos, number of bedrooms, price, etc. The data comes from renthop.com, an apartment listing website. These apartments are located in New York City.
